   This project was created as a part of INSAID EDA project to analyse the Automobile dataset to help the manufacturer to find out what people exactly wants, which type of cars are selling more, what are the price range of cars which are selling more etc.

In this project the problem statements are :
1. Determine the prices of vehicles with multiple makes using various features like make, fuel-type, mileage, engine-type, engine-size, body-style, horsepower and many more.
2. Which are the highest number of vehicles based on brand, body style and price slab?
3. Do the Body Style and Engine Specification determine the vehicle price?
